## ⚠️ The Challenge

Default WooCommerce filtering causes poor UX and performance issues on Flatsome-powered stores:

- Full page reloads on every filter
- Broken lazy load or infinite scroll with generic filter plugins
- Non-indexable filter URLs (bad for SEO)
- Heavy JS payloads and inefficient queries
